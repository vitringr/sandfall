# Main

Debug and figure out why it's drifting. Use the JS program if needed.

Or, if it doesn't work, just fuck it and write a separate function for every cell in block.

Actually this might not be so bad.

# Spread

Have different levels of spread.

Continue using only one cardinal velocity with them.
