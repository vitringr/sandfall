# Main

Experiment with separate function for every cell? Idk.

# Fire

Change pixel color every frame

# Gas Gravity

Thinking of ways to make different spread:
- Randomize to sometimes change the velocity of heavy spread particles like fire?
- Remove the cardinal velocity limit and sometimes add multiple velocities to them.
- Function that sometimes randomizes the velocity of said particles. Maybe somehow revert it back later.


# Spawner
